## SPEC 1 - slope convention passed to `correction_factor()`

Verified `R/mp_risk_utils.R::correction_factor()` integrates the exponent it receives directly as `L^(a + 1)` and does not internally subtract 1 unless `slope_convention = "cumulative"` is now requested. The prior notebook path passed the cumulative C-PSD slope (`a_cpsd`) as if it were the differential PSD slope, reproducing the legacy CF values.

Changed the notebook CF path to sample and pass the differential slope `a_psd = a_cpsd - 1` with `slope_convention = "differential"`. Added a `testthat` guard reproducing the Koelmans-style worked example: 30-2000 um to 1-5000 um with alpha = 1.6 gives CF = 8.319.

Verified before/after CF medians from a lightweight local R run:

| Matrix | `a_cpsd` | `a_psd` | bias-corrected measured range (um) | Legacy CF p50 | Corrected fit-only CF p50 | Corrected structural-SD CF p50 | Corrected structural-SD CF p05-p95 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| River water | -1.926 | -2.926 | 165-385 | 208.0 | 23077.8 | 23257.0 | 3110.2-186335.7 |
| Sediment | -1.990 | -2.990 | 135-500 | 177.2 | 18759.1 | 18760.8 | 2604.3-133648.7 |
| Ocean water | -1.767 | -2.767 | 95-245 | 63.4 | 3844.1 | 3783.7 | 666.9-23693.3 |

Open questions: Full report render is still needed to capture before/after EED, RQ, and P(RQ>1) after PSSD++ hazard propagation.

## SPEC 2 - widened slope uncertainty

Added `slope_structural_sd` as an explicit model assumption in the QMD setup and extended `alpha_dist()` so structural/model-form uncertainty is added in quadrature to the fit SE. The river MC2D sensitivity table samples widened CF distributions in the outer uncertainty loop.

Open questions: `slope_structural_sd = 0.25` is a documented default aligned with the wide-prior precedent, not a measured site-specific value.

## SPEC 3 - depth-stratified sensitivity

Verified river surface and subsurface strata are both large enough for C-PSD and monitoring bootstrap sensitivity. Added depth-stratified C-PSD slope plotting plus surface/subsurface EED and HC5 RQ sensitivity tables.

Open questions: Pooled results remain the headline assessment until a mechanistic depth/transport correction is parameterized.

## SPEC 4 - critical size and dual-slope diagnostic

Added `estimate_critical_size()` using explicit delta and K assumptions and `piecewise_cpsd_diagnostic()` for two-segment C-PSD screening. Added an all-matrix table reporting critical size, fit-window straddling, and piecewise AIC diagnostics.

Open questions: `delta_m = 0.10` and `K_m2_s = 1e-5` are placeholders that need field justification before mechanistic use.

## SPEC 5 - polymer-resolved density

Added a polymer-density lookup, per-particle `density_g_cm3`, density group, freshwater/marine buoyancy flags, and fixed-density sensitivity mass columns. The lookup includes TODO(cite) source placeholders rather than fabricated bibliographic detail.

Open questions: Select and cite the canonical polymer-density source table.

## SPEC 6 - water-sediment coherence check

Added a river-water vs sediment size-spectrum ECDF and slope summary to interpret whether sediment enrichment is coherent with transport sorting.

Open questions: This is interpretive inference only; no mass-balance correction was applied.

## SPEC 7 - revised conclusion

Replaced the previous "no additional data correction warranted" statement with a calibrated uncertainty discussion naming transport-induced PSD distortion while retaining the existing mesh-selectivity and Wang et al. double-counting exclusions.

## SPEC 8 - geometry-priority guardrail

Added a modeling-priorities note directing future transport work toward measured 3-D geometry and density before settling-equation refinement, and labeling settling diagnostics as bias-level sensitivities.
